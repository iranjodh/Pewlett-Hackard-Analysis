  As visible in the above age, almost 65% of the Staff in the company is senior which is of retirement age. The company needs high volume of Recuirtment and selection in the near future. In addition, the company also needs to decide what will be the criteria for mentorship program because not all retiring staff will be able to join the mentorship program.
